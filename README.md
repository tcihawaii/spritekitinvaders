# spritekitinvaders

This project is the code and assets for the sprite kit invaders tutorial, which you probably found via youtube at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnGjyjSWyBKJ5p36c0mnNQeRFNYdpbbL

You can follow along with this video series by using this code if you don't want to type everything out as I do on the videos.  There's endless fixes and optimizations you could make, I was more concerned with finishing my tutorial than making the slimmest code possible.  You don't have to accept the mistakes I made if you know a better way of course :)

Thanks for your interest and feel free to drop me a note if you have any thoughts.
